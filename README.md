## Project description 

X-ray binaries containing a black hole and a massive star are among the most promising observational candidates for binary black holes (BBHs) progenitors. Mass transfer events play a crucial role in shrinking the orbit of these systems, facilitating their eventual merger. In particular, we focus on Wolf-Rayet stars as they form as a result of significant mass transfer and strong stellar winds that strip away the hydrogen envelope of a massive star. Under the right conditions, a binary system can evolve into a black hole â€“ Wolf-Rayet star system. Such systems may become visible as X-ray binaries because the intense stellar winds can lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the black hole, producing powerful X-ray emissions.

In this project, we utilize the outputs of the population synthesis code SEVN (Stellar EVolution for N-body). The primary objective is to identify the key parameters that determine whether a black hole - Wolf-Rayet star system will evolve into a BBH system that eventually merges via emission of gravitational waves within a Hubble time.
