We work with binary systems whose evolution is described by SEVN including the following processes: wind mass transfer, Roche-lobe overflow (RLO), common envelope (CE), stellar tides, circularization at the RLO onset, collision at periastron, orbit decay by GW emission, and stellar mergers.\n",

To decide the time-step, it looks at a sub-set of stellar and binary properties: if any of them changes too much during a time-step, it reduces the time-step and repeats the calculation. A special treatment is used when a star approaches a change of phase to guarantee that the stellar properties are evaluated just after and before the change of phase. \n",

    "The best performance is achieved when the number of workers and threads is set to 4. This is because the code takes full advantage of multithreading. When the number of threads is low, performance is worse because the potential of multithreading isn't fully utilized. The worst performance occurs when both the number of workers and threads is set to 1. In this case, parallelization is limited to the use of the three virtual machines, but we fail to make use of the fact that each virtual machine has a multicore CPU, leading to inefficient resource utilization."
